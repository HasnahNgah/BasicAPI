we'll need a post route here now. Router.post with the path of /standup and a callback function with two properties, request and response. Now in the body of this function is where we start to make use of the Mongoose model we just finished. Let note = new Standup, and pass in the req.body, which will be a JSON object. We need to go back to the top of this file and add a reference to the standup model. Const Standup = require, and move back a couple folders, models/standup. Back in the callback function, note here is the Mongoose document instance of the Standup model we just required, and as such, we now have access to the model's save method. Note.save with a callback function where the first property is any errors that may be returned and the second, the note document that was saved. We can test to see if there were any errors returned, and if so, notify the consumer of this API endpoint, returning a status of 400 and the error object as JSON. Otherwise, we're good, and therefore, let's return a status of 200 and the actual note document as JSON. Just to save a little time, I'll paste in code for projects and team. The code is nearly identical to what we just looked at with the standup
